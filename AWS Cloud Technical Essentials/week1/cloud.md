# What Is the Cloud? — Exam-Focused Notes

## Traditional On-Premises Model
- Companies hosted **compute, storage, and networking** in their own data centers
- Required:
  - Hardware purchases
  - Infrastructure teams
  - High upfront costs
- Result:
  - Slow experimentation
  - Limited scalability
  - Expensive idle capacity

---

## Cloud Computing Definition (EXAM CRITICAL)
**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing**.

- No need to own or manage physical hardware
- Providers like **AWS** own and operate data centers
- Resources are **virtualized** and accessed via the internet

---

## On-Premises vs Cloud (Key Comparison)

### On-Premises
- Requires:
  - Buying hardware
  - Installing OS
  - Cabling, power, cooling
- Provisioning takes **days or weeks**
- Slower time-to-market

### Cloud
- Environments can be:
  - Replicated in **minutes or seconds**
- Infrastructure is managed **logically**, not physically
- Faster deployment and testing (e.g., QA environments)

---

## Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting (EXAM TERM)
- Tasks that **do not provide business differentiation**
  - Installing servers
  - Managing backups
  - Maintaining hardware
- Cloud providers handle these tasks
- Businesses focus on:
  - Application code
  - Innovation
  - Customer value

---

## AWS Role in Cloud Computing
- AWS provides **cloud computing services**
- These services are the IT resources:
  - Compute
  - Storage
  - Networking
- Used to build:
  - Scalable
  - Highly available
  - Cost-effective architectures

---

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing (MEMORIZE)

### 1. Pay As You Go
- No upfront investment
- Pay only for what you use

### 2. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale
- AWS aggregates usage across many customers
- Lower costs than running your own data centers

### 3. Stop Guessing Capacity
- No over-provisioning or under-provisioning
- Scale resources up or down as needed

### 4. Increase Speed and Agility
- Provision resources in minutes
- Faster experimentation and development

### 5. Stop Spending Money on Data Centers
- No need to manage physical infrastructure
- Focus on business-critical work
- Eliminates **undifferentiated heavy lifting**

### 6. Go Global in Minutes
- Deploy applications in multiple AWS Regions
- Lower latency for users worldwide
- Minimal additional cost

## Exam Takeaway Summary
- Cloud = on-demand + pay-as-you-go
- AWS manages physical infrastructure
- Cloud enables:
  - Scalability
  - High availability
  - Faster innovation
- The **six advantages** are frequently tested
