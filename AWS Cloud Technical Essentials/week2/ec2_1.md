# Introduction to Amazon EC2 — Exam Notes

## What Is Amazon EC2? (EXAM CRITICAL)
**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a web service that provides:
- **Secure**
- **Resizable**
- **Compute capacity** in the cloud

➡️ EC2 lets you launch **virtual servers**, called **EC2 instances**.

---

## Key EC2 Characteristics
- EC2 instances can run:
  - Web servers
  - APIs
  - Batch jobs
  - Any application
- EC2 is managed using:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS CLI
  - AWS SDKs
  - Automation / orchestration tools

---

## What You Define When Launching an EC2 Instance
When creating an EC2 instance, you configure:

### Hardware Configuration
- CPU
- Memory
- Networking
- Storage

### Logical Configuration
- Operating system
- Networking location (VPC, subnet)
- Firewall rules (security groups)
- Authentication (key pairs)

---

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI) — EXAM CORE CONCEPT
An **AMI** is a template used to create EC2 instances.

An AMI includes:
- Operating system
- Storage mappings
- CPU architecture (x86, ARM)
- Pre-installed software (optional)

➡️ In AWS, OS installation is **built into the AMI**.

---

## AMI vs EC2 Instance (VERY IMPORTANT)
- **AMI** = Blueprint / Template
- **EC2 Instance** = Running virtual server

### Exam Analogy
- AMI : EC2 Instance  
- Recipe : Cake  
- Class : Object

---

## How EC2 Launch Works (High Level)
1. AWS allocates a virtual machine
2. The selected AMI is copied to the **root device volume**
3. The instance boots using that image
4. You connect and install additional software

---

## Key Advantage of AMIs — Reusability
- AMIs allow **consistent, repeatable deployments**
- Avoids:
  - Manual configuration
  - Human error

### Best Practice
- Configure one EC2 instance
- Create an **AMI from it**
- Launch new instances from that AMI

---

## AMI Sources (EXAM FAVORITE)
You can choose AMIs from:

### 1. Quick Start AMIs
- Created and maintained by AWS
- Common operating systems

### 2. AWS Marketplace AMIs
- Third-party software
- Open-source or commercial

### 3. My AMIs
- Custom AMIs you create from EC2 instances

### 4. Community AMIs
- Shared by AWS users
- Use with caution

### 5. EC2 Image Builder
- Automates creation of custom AMIs

---

## AMI IDs — EXAM DETAIL
- Each AMI has an ID:
  - Format: `ami-xxxxxxxx`
- AMI IDs are:
  - **Region-specific**
  - Unique per region

---

## Exam Takeaway Summary
- EC2 = virtual servers
- AMI = instance template
- Instances are created **from AMIs**
- AMIs are reusable and region-specific
- Understanding EC2 + AMI is foundational
