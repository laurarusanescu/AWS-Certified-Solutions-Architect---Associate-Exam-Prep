- Data drives:
  - Business decisions
  - Strategy
  - Competitive advantage
- Sharing data **beyond a single team** uncovers insights that isolated views cannot
- Sharing across:
  - Teams
  - Business units
  - Companies
  creates **greater overall value**

## Treating Data as a Product (EXAM CONCEPT)

### What Does “Data as a Product” Mean?
- Each dataset is treated like a **product**
- Owned by a **specific team**
- Managed through its **entire lifecycle**:
  - Creation
  - Maintenance
  - Improvement
  - Retirement

➡️ Clear ownership = higher quality & reliability

---

## Why Data Products Work
- Teams are accountable for their data
- Consumers know:
  - Who owns the data
  - How trustworthy it is
- Easier to:
  - Scale sharing
  - Enforce governance
  - Improve over time

---

## Expanding Data Sharing
1. Start with a **single line of business**
2. That team owns and publishes data products
3. Data is consumed:
   - Internally
   - Externally
4. Expand the model across other teams and units

➡️ Creates a structured, scalable data ecosystem

## Governance Becomes Critical
As data sharing increases, governance must cover:
- Discovery
- Access control
- Auditing
- Compliance
- Reporting

➡️ Governance ensures:
- Data quality
- Regulatory compliance
- Trust across teams
